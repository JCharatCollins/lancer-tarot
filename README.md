## Run locally:

First, run the development server:

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Where to visit:

Currently available on [Vercel](https://lancer-tarot.vercel.app/) and [Azure](https://witty-moss-0c8c2ca0f.5.azurestaticapps.net/) (I wanted to try out Azure's student plan).

## Future steps:

Finish the home page!

Actually finish the last 6-ish Tarot card builds and import the data.

Popularity analytics/comment section/difficulty ratings/reviews? Would need to use Azure DB for backend but a basic PostgresSQL DB is not hard to set up.

Responsive design--lot of CSS work needs to be done to get this running nicely on mobile.

Light mode!
