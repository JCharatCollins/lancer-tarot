      "quote": "\"Hoom... Young man, I am dead. I was killed in what, for me at least, were fairly unpleasant circumstances. It hurt. It was deeply upsetting, and painful. However, it happened. I am dead. If you bring me back to life, my death will have no meaning. I had a fine existence. I was a good place. I spent a little time walking the waking world. I even fell in love, once, a little. I lived a good life and it ended. Would you take that away from me?\"\n-Fiddler's Green, Neil Gaiman, The Sandman",
